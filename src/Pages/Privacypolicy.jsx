                            <h2>2. Data Minimization</h2>
                            <p>We will keep personal information adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was provided. We will not collect personal information in advance or store personal information for future purposes, unless required or permitted by laws or regulations.</p>

                            <h2>3. Intended Use of Personal Information</h2>
                            <p>We will only use the personal information for one or more specified and legitimate purposes. Personal information will not be used or processed in any manner incompatible with those purposes. When we need to use your personal information beyond the scope of such purposes, we shall obtain your consent, except when extended use would be permitted by laws or regulations.</p>

                            <p>We will keep personal information no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal information was provided. Unless otherwise permitted by laws and regulations, personal information that is no longer needed or relevant will be purged or deleted.</p>

                            <h2>6. Management of Personal Information</h2>
                            <p>Your personal information is subject to data secrecy. In managing personal information, we assign an officer in charge of handling personal information and take appropriate and adequate protective measures on a technical and organizational level against unauthorized or unlawful use and processing.</p>

                            <h2>7. Provision to Third Parties</h2>
                            <p>Unless otherwise permitted by laws and regulations, we will not provide your personal information to any third party without your consent. In addition, your personal information will not be transferred to another country or territory unless that country or territory will ensure an adequate level of data protection.</p>

                            <h2>8. Inquiries, Corrections, and Erasure of Personal Information</h2>
                            <p>We acknowledge that you have the right to know what of your personal information we hold and have the right to access your personal information, ask for rectification, removal, or object to the (automated) processing of it. We will respond promptly in a suitable and reasonable manner to any inquiry from you about your personal information or requests for corrections or erasure.</p>

                            <h2>9. Compliance with Laws and Regulations, and Commitment to this Policy</h2>
                            <p>We fully abide by all laws and regulations concerning personal information protection in each country (e.g. Act on the Protection of Personal Information [Act No. 57 of May 30, 2003], the General Data Protection Regulation [EU 2016/679]).
